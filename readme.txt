Makes the comment textarea expand in height automatically

== Description ==

Getting comments on your site is one of the most important goals. Longer comments tend to be especially valuable.

However, most comment textareas have a small height, making it difficult to write long comments.

*Enter Autogrow*

Here's how it works: When a commenter almost fills the textarea, instead of getting a scrollbar, the textarea grows in height.

This means (s)he can see the entire comment while it's being written, no matter how long it is.

You can try it for yourself on the [Plugin's homepage](http://scribu.net/wordpress/comment-autogrow/ca-1-0.html#respond).

It uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-growfield/">Growfield</a> plugin for jQuery.

== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip "comment-autogrow" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
